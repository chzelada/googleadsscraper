# Google Ads Scraper

This is the R code I use to scrap ads information from google. I did this as a personal project, to better understand web scrapping.

If you try to make more than 30 searches **google will ban your ip** for 15 or 20 minutes so be carefull. 
You just need to input 2 varibles,
 
 **State:** state from where you want the search to be mode from
 
 **KeyWord:** Search term
